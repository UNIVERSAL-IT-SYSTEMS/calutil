###Why bulk-delete iCloud Calendar events?

The total number of calandars, events and reminders on iCloud can not exceed 25,000.

Applications that depend on iCloud data sync might have to do some regular house keeping to keep the number of records under control. 

This command-line tool allows one to do the following:

* Count the number of events stored on iCloud Calendars
* Delete old events stored on iCloud Calendars
